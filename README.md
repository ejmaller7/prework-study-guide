# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

The motivation for this project was to build a webpage study guide in order to both practice the coding learned during prework, as well as to jot notes down to ensure that I am grasping the material.  I built this project in order to acquire both knowledge and practice of the basics of coding to better prepare me for the course.  This problem resolves any issues with not having a study guide by both creating a study guide to study the notes that were taken, but also provide practice making the study guide.  I was able to learn basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning the basic commands of working in a project in GitHub.
